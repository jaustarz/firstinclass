/*How I'm going to do this is by making the meal cost an array*/
/*Then I'm going to list all the other variables*/
/*I'll use scanf to ask for the tip and tax percentage*/
/*I included a random number generator that generated the numbers 1-4*/
/*The number corresponds to the array number of the meal cost, so it will display one of the meal costs*/
/*It goes through a for loop and then the random number will equal the array number*/
/*Then it calculates the tax cost and tip cost and adds those numbers to the total bill and then prints the total bill*/
