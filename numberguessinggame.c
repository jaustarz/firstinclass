/*For this program I will insert a random number generator that picks between 1 and 10*/
/*Then I will use a while loop to create the game. I'll create the menu in the loop*/
/*Then I will put an if statement in the while loop to get the game working*/
/*Use scanf for the initial input, and if said input is more or less than the random number, you lose the game*/
/*Make an if statement for changing the max value, and the max value can't be more than 10 and less than 1*/
/*If you press 3 the game just ends*/
